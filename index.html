<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>I am currently in full time education at Cardff University studying Computer Science. I am an enthusiastic professional who is a fast learner and can work either as a member of a team or leading a team. I can work based on my own initiative, and can work based on the instruction of others. I am motivated and charismatic, as well as having good communication skills which allow me to worok as part of a team, as well as communication with customers. I enjoy the challenge of hard work, and work well under pressure.</p>

<p>In terms of Computer Science experience I enjoy web design and development, as well as problem solving using programming. I have experience in Python, Visual Basic, HMTL, and CSS. Due to the fact that I am currently in university my knowledge and skills are developing every day. I have also begun to teach myself PHP, through codecademy, in order to assist in the building of a website my friends and I are making. I believe that by learning this outside of university I am showing the true interest I have in Computer Science, and therefore the motivation I have to work hard in the field. I hope that my studies at Cardiff University will further enhance my skills so that I can continue to program and enjoy Computer Science once I have left university. </p>

<p>I will be the first to admit that my professional experience is lacking, and I believe that currently this is one of my greatest weaknesses. However, I have completed a work experience placement in the technology division of JPMorgan, which was both highly relevant to my degree and was extremely useful in teaching me professional etiquette and giving me an idea of what the skills required to be successful in work. I believe that since that placement I have improved those skills, and I regularly put them into practice. </p>

<p>As for my hobbies, I am a keen reader and I also enjoy playing video games when I get the time. I like to spend time on my computer as technology is something that interests me, hence why I am studying computer science. I hope soon to buy a Rasberry Pi in order to continue this interest in technology by working on fun projects outside of university.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to focus on putting my skills into practice, as well as developing and improving myself. I look forward to the responsibilities of being in work, while completing my studies at university.</p>
